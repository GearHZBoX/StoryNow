Li Chengyi held my waist and held me in his arms, whispering in my ear [How many boyfriends am I to you? ”
I felt my face flushed by his focused eyes, and I deliberately counted my fingers to tease him [One, two, three]
Until I felt the hand on my waist getting closer and closer, I confessed [You are the first one]
Li Chengyi's originally gloomy face instantly bloomed into a beautiful smile, he leaned in and kissed me [You will also be the last one. ”

The first time I met Li Chengyi was in the kindergarten where I was a math teacher a year ago.
At that time, there was a little girl in the class who was very naughty and often had conflicts with children in other classes. I had no choice but to call her parents to come over to communicate.
In the small office, I made a pot of tea and handed it to the man. He nodded to express his gratitude, but his brows were still furrowed, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.
"Well, Xiaomai, I think Xiaomai's behavior in school is...]
[There is a reason why Xiaomai behaves like this in school. I see that the housekeeper usually comes to pick her up and she is always alone in school. I think she lacks the company of her family and wants to attract the attention of teachers and classmates at school, so she has conflicts with other children.]
He lowered his head and thought for a while, his eyes focused on me: "My parents are working abroad, Xiaomai insists on living with me, and I have to work, so I can't take good care of her. It's my fault as a brother]
"How about I help you take care of the child?" I just said this , then realized that something was wrong and explained, "I also have a younger brother. I took care of him when he was young. If you are relieved, I can help pick up Xiaomai, cook for her, and accompany her to finish her homework before going back. Anyway, I have nothing to do after get off work." He stood up from the mini stool that was not in line with his height of 190 cm, and excitedly held my hands with both hands, his eyes full of sincerity: "If that's the case, I am very grateful to our teacher Xu. I will pay you according to the market price."

That afternoon, when the children were out of school, the man did not come. After the children were gone, I walked out holding Xiaomai's hand. "Xiaomai, what's your brother's name?" I asked her. "What's his name?" The little girl actually thought for a while, "Oh, Li Chengyi." Just then, my mobile phone rang, and I took it out to see that I had added Li Chengyi as a friend. I clicked to enter the dialog box, which was a location. The address is... Villa in the rich area! ! ! Why would a family like this hire a nanny? Why would they need me, a social animal who earns three or four thousand yuan a month, to get involved?
But he seemed to see through my thoughts. He pointed to a room casually: "Our housekeeper used to live there. Now she has moved out. Teacher Xu can move in if it is convenient."
Can't you just take me home? Not a gentleman at all.
"I didn't bring pajamas." I surrendered.
He raised his lips and smiled faintly: "The first drawer on the left side of the right room, take any pajamas from it."
I nodded, walked in and opened the drawer, but what caught my eye were pieces of sexy pajamas.
"Mr. Li, do you often bring women home?" I held the scraps of cloth in front of him.
"What is this! This is not mine." He denied it flatly.
I nodded: "It's really not yours. This cloth can't cover anything for you."
"It's really not mine!"

Just like that, I inexplicably stayed at the home of a man I had known for less than a day. There was nothing special. When I woke up the next morning, Li Chengyi had left.
The next few days were calm. Except for a part-time job after get off work, nothing seemed to have changed in my life.
Li Chengyi came back more often, and Xiaomai's personality became more cheerful.
I think he is a person with a sharp tongue and a soft heart. He thinks I am silly and enthusiastic. Although we don't like each other, I miss him when I don't see him for a day.
I thought our ordinary co-living relationship would continue until that day.
I was reading "Snow White" to Xiaomai on her bed, and Li Chengyi suddenly walked in. He was not wearing clothes, showing his strong abdominal muscles. I have never seen a man without clothes except my father, so I shyly glanced away.
The child asked Li Chengyi and me to sleep with her, mumbling in a daze: "Brother is the father, Teacher Shushu is the mother, and will never leave Xiaomai."
We both denied it almost in unison.
The little girl was anxious, "Brother, don't you like Teacher Shushu?"
"I like you, please go to bed soon." I took over the topic to coax her, just hoping that she would go to bed early.
After finally coaxing the naughty child to sleep, I was a little tired, and pushed open the door of my room to rest. At this moment, a hand pressed against the door, and I felt a heat coming from behind.
"... You said you like me."
"I coaxed the child, otherwise how could she be willing to sleep." I was a little flustered and hurried to deny.
"Oh, I coaxed the child. Is that all?"

After that day, Li Chengyi seemed to avoid me on his own initiative, and I had no reason to look for him. I was happy to be free, but my heart was empty, as if something was missing.
In a blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve. Xiaomai was taken abroad by her parents to celebrate the New Year together, but Li Chengyi was unable to go with Xiaomai due to work reasons.
Xiaomai left, and I had no reason to stay here. I packed my things and prepared to go home. He had just come back from outside, looked at the luggage in my hand, and asked softly: "Leaving?"
"Well, the New Year is coming soon! I will go back first, Happy New Year!"
He didn't say anything, just looked at me, as if he had something to say, but he didn't say it out loud, and finally forced out a word "OK".
I don't know why, but a strange impulse suddenly surged in my heart.
"Celebrate the New Year with me."
In fact, except for Li Chengyi's bad temper, other aspects are impeccable.
When we got to my house, we talked to each other. This feeling was so familiar that I almost forgot that night. He pressed against the door frame and asked me aggrievedly: "Is what you said true?"
I came out of the shower and brought some fruit from the kitchen. I tasted one and fed it to him at the same time. He took it naturally with his mouth, and then turned his head and stared at me as if he felt something was wrong.
Oh my God! What am I doing! Isn't this an indirect kiss? My mind is dizzy?

The next morning, Li Chengyi returned to the villa to get some official supplies to be undertaken. I followed him. I don't know why, but I just have some inexplicable dependence. Wherever he goes, I want to follow him.
Someone knocked on the door, I went to open it, and what caught my eye was a frivolous man with yellow hair. "Am I in the wrong place? Isn't this Cheng Yi's home?"
After inviting him in, I heard him interrogating Li Cheng Yi who was standing next to him: "Fuck, you are a good guy! This girl is pretty! Where did you kidnap her from?"
Li Cheng Yi seemed unhappy and said in a bad tone: "Don't call her this girl, call her sister-in-law."
I pretended not to hear it and knocked on the door normally, and put the tea on the table. The frivolous man said, "Thank you," and half-jokingly praised me for my good looks.
About half an hour later, the frivolous man was about to leave after talking to Li Cheng Yi. As soon as he reached the entrance, he rushed to the room where the sexy underwear was kept as if he suddenly remembered something, and shouted, "Li Cheng Yi, you bastard, where are the classic ones I put in that drawer?"
I realized immediately, so those sexy underwear were not Li Cheng Yi's, but this man's?
My heart was pounding, and all I could think about was Li Chengyi.

Over the entire Spring Festival, the relationship between Li Chengyi and I had changed subtly. There was some ambiguity, and some affection was spreading, but no one broke through that thin window paper, as if once it was broken, they were afraid of changes and alienation.
But two weeks after the kindergarten started, about Friday afternoon, it was my turn and another teacher's turn to be on duty. Xiaomai was playing with toys and seemed active and lively, but Lulu was abnormal, with her head down and drowsy. I touched Lulu's forehead, and it was as hot as boiled water.
I hurriedly picked her up and called the reserved parent phone number. Lulu's father's company was nearby, and he rushed over in a few minutes.
One day at noon, I had just coaxed the children to sleep and wanted to go back to the office to drink some water, and I heard a cursing voice not far away, and then a woman in high heels pushed open the door of my office and slapped me with all her strength.
The huge commotion attracted colleagues and the headmaster nearby. They stopped Lulu's mother to ask about the situation, but she was like a mad dog, completely unmoved and madly insulting me, calling me a "bitch".
Someone took a photo of me getting into Lulu's father's car and sent it to Lulu's mother with an unfamiliar number. At that time, I was holding Lulu and her father was opening the car door for us. Because of the ambiguous angle, she believed it.
In addition, Lulu's father seemed to have a woman outside. The couple was recently getting divorced. Such a photo just pointed the finger at me.
That afternoon, the headmaster found me and suggested that I take a two-week leave to see how things develop. In fact, I understood the implication that the kindergarten did not need a female teacher like me, so I went back and thought about it carefully. Finally, I chose to resign on my own initiative.
I sent a text message to Li Chengyi, asking him to pick up Xiaomai in the afternoon and submitted my resignation to him. I did not read Li Chengyi's long reply.
I was unconscious and slept for two whole days.
Until a strange phone call came in, I picked up the phone in a daze, and the smell of alcohol had not yet dissipated.
"Li Chengyi was hit by a car and is now unconscious in the hospital. You should come to see him for the last time."
Li Chengyi is dying. I don't know what's going on. I have been crying and mentally exhausted these days. Now it is enough to make me lose my mind. I am going crazy. I opened the door, and the moment the sun shone in, I fell into an extremely familiar embrace. It was Li Chengyi, he was not dead.
"Xu Xinshu, I really don't know what to do with you. I liked you from the beginning, so I invited you to my house. Otherwise, do you think I would let women into my house casually? You are so good, making me angry all day long, and now you are playing missing at every turn. Sooner or later, I will be killed by you." He cursed in his mouth, but his hands were very honest. He patted my back gently, like comforting a child, clumsy and serious.
Is he confessing to me? Until my eyes were level with his, I kissed his cheek and rubbed my nose against his.

"Are you serious?" Although I had noticed it, I still didn't believe that the bad-tempered Li Chengyi would fall in love with me and confess to me, "Why?"
I thought of what he said, that he liked me from the beginning, so he invited me to his home, and then I realized that the longest road in the world was Li Chengyi's routine.
"Do you know what your biggest shortcoming is?" He suddenly asked.
I looked up and thought about it: "Maybe it's stupidity, if it's not stupid, you won't cause trouble everywhere."
"Xu Xinshu, what are you thinking? Is that your fault? As a people's teacher, you are doing your job conscientiously, and the fault is those who framed you. Your biggest shortcoming is that you are too credulous."
Li Chengyi is the first and only person who said to me "You are not wrong".
"I have sent people to check, and the man does have a woman outside. The woman is hidden in a dilapidated residential house in the northeast building of the city." Li Chengyi stroked my hand.
"Li Chengyi, what do you do for a living? Why do you know all this?" "Is it difficult to know this?" He smiled, showing his two canine teeth, and continued, "I have sent someone to take photos of the man and the woman having an affair, but even so, you cannot be completely cleared of suspicion. We must find the mastermind behind the scenes." "Where there is a conflict of interest, there will be a battlefield. I have been working in the business world since the beginning. You don't know as much about these things as I do." He was so proud of himself, like a child, "There are only two possibilities now. The first is that the murderer is the father of the child. In order to divert his wife's attention from the mistress, he specifically directed the war to you. The second is your colleague." To be honest, when I first learned the truth, I was a little uncertain, because on weekdays, everyone seemed to be in harmony, and no one had any reason to harm me. I listened to Li Chengyi's advice and made a fake call to Lulu's father when I returned to the office two weeks later, so that Fu Ju, who was in the same office, happened to hear it. She was afraid that our meeting would be exposed, so she waited at the address agreed on by phone, and was caught by Li Chengyi who followed behind.
The cause was jealousy, jealous that I was loved by children and trusted by parents, while she was cold and faced the dilemma of being fired. She learned from Lulu that the child's parents had recently quarreled because of a woman outside, and happened to see me get into Lulu's father's car. She was obsessed for a while and came up with this bad idea.

The truth came out, Fu Ju was fired for this, and I started working soon.
Xiaomai even pestered me, saying that she would make me go home with her no matter what, "Teacher Shushu, I missed you so much during this period, and so did my brother."
At the dinner table, Xiaomai suddenly spoke, and Li Chengyi rubbed Xiaomai's hair lovingly and said softly,
"In the future, call me Teacher Shushu at school, and call me sister-in-law at home, understand?"
Xiaomai nodded obediently, and then asked, "Sister-in-law, will you sleep with me tonight?"
Before I could answer, Li Chengyi took over the conversation, "Your sister-in-law will sleep with me tonight."
After dinner, after coaxing Xiaomai to sleep, I was ready to hide in my room, Unexpectedly, Li Chengyi pushed me against the door again like last time, and asked again in Xiaomai's tone, "Does Teacher Shushu like me?"
I didn't dare to look at his face directly, and buried my head lower and lower, and said in a voice as thin as a mosquito, "Yes."

From that day on, we officially lived together. We were both first love, and we didn't know how to fall in love. We were both aiming for marriage. Although his family was well-off, his parents were very open-minded. During the video call, they kept urging us to have children as soon as possible, which made me very embarrassed. Li Chengyi, who was standing next to me, laughed so hard that he couldn't even straighten his waist.
I glared at him and signaled that there was Xiaomai beside him, asking him to restrain himself as much as possible, but he picked me up and looked down at the little kid: "I'm going to sleep with your sister-in-law, you'll sleep alone today~"
Xiaomai pouted and expressed dissatisfaction: "Brother is so old and still needs someone to sleep with him, shame on you."
At the critical moment, Xiaomai was still very strong and stood on the same front with her brother, "Sister-in-law, no one will want him except you, just agree to him!"
I picked up Xiaomai with a smile and nodded, and waited for Li Chengyi to put the ring on me before I said proudly, "I agreed to you for Xiaomai's sake."
After falling in love, Li Chengyi's poisonous tongue fighting power has obviously weakened a lot, and he no longer argues with me. He stood up and took Xiaomai with one hand, hugged me with the other hand, and said, "My wife is right."`;
