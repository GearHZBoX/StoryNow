const text = `A woman added me on WeChat and sent me a photo: "Your husband is cutting mangoes for me."  
When we met, she told me that in the face of love, she and I were equals, and that my husband was too repressed being with me.  
I found it both funny and ridiculous.  
But I wanted her to truly understand that what she called "love" was worthless.  

**1**  
I’m with my husband not because he’s extraordinary, but because he treats me well.  
I thought I would always be cherished.  
From a young age, I knew one thing: even if I did nothing my whole life, my father—a general manager of a top ten real estate company—had enough assets to ensure I lived a life of luxury and excess.  
I met my husband during a psychology industry summit when we were in our senior year of university. He was in charge of business cooperation for the event, while I was a nobody sent by my company.  
He gave me his business card, which read "Business Director, Zhuang Yang."  
Then, he added me on WeChat.  
Then, he pursued me.  
Zhuang Yang was a very considerate boyfriend.  
He remembered every time my period was due and would leave a thermos filled with brown sugar water in my bag.  
He would go shopping with me and give me lots of advice while I tried on clothes, unlike other macho men.  
He also bought gifts for my parents from time to time. How could my boyfriend ignore my parents?  
Later, I happily married Zhuang Yang, just as my parents had hoped.  
At our wedding, I overheard some whispers, "President Li's fortune is benefiting an outsider, someone without a house or a car."  
But we had love!  
Those vulgar people!  

**2**  
A month ago, that love was torn open, exposing the darkest parts and forcing me to see its shattered remains.  
That day, after finishing a counseling session, I opened my phone to see a WeChat friend request from a woman.  
She didn’t say anything, just sent me a photo.  
In the picture, a man was cutting a golden mango with a fruit knife, his face obscured.  
Then, she sent another message:  
"Your husband is cutting mangoes for me."  
In that moment, I couldn’t breathe.  
The man was Zhuang Yang.  
Because the scar on the back of the man’s left hand, Zhuang Yang had the same scar.  
There was nothing in her WeChat profile—just a blank white avatar, no signature, no moments, and even her WeChat ID was a random sequence.  
I pondered for a long time before sending, "Who are you?"  
But she didn’t reply for a long time.

**3**  
After graduating, I opened my own psychology counseling studio in Pudong, funded by my father. But to this day, business hasn’t been great.  
Everyone said it’s because I have it too good—wonderful parents, a doting husband.  
That person just sent a photo; it could mean anything!  
But I was really scared.  
That night, I sent her another message on WeChat:  
"Let’s meet."  
It took her a long time to reply:  
"Okay, your office will do."  
She even knew where I worked, but I didn’t even know if she was male or female.  
"Okay, Monday at 4 PM."  
I was fully booked that day, with only that slot available.  
At 3 PM, an unfamiliar girl was sitting in the waiting area of my office.  
With just one look, I knew who she was.  
She had long flowing hair, wore a linen dress with no accessories—dressed like a literary young woman.  
But her fair skin and heaving chest as she looked up at me exuded a sensual allure.  
This was exactly the type Zhuang Yang liked.  
The girl took a deep breath, sat across from me, and without any greeting, dove straight in.  
"Everyone has the right to pursue love, right?"

**4**  
I maintained a straight posture, but her opening line shocked me.  
I never expected the conversation to start this way.  
"Aren’t you going to introduce yourself first?"  
She said her name was Lin Wanwan, but I guessed it was an alias.  
She was 22 years old, a senior at a university in Baoshan, and from her accent, she wasn’t a local.  
"Human rights are inherent, and even the constraints of marriage cannot stop people from pursuing love and freedom."  
"All men are created equal; there should be no such thing as marriage in this world."  
"In the face of love, you and I are equals!!!"  
The more she spoke, the more emotional she became. Every word was a challenge to me, insisting she was right, Zhuang Yang was right, and love was right.  
I was the one in the wrong.  
I truly was wrong.  
I deliberately dropped my pen on the floor, then bent down to pick it up as I said, "Let me pick this up first."  
Then I spoke up,  
"Are you an Aquarius?"  
She froze, not expecting such a question, but nodded obediently.  
"How did you know?"  
Because I’m also an Aquarius. In college, I was so romantic I almost lost myself, idolizing Lady Chatterley’s Lover and all those tales that defined my view of love back then.  
Lin Wanwan seemed unhappy that I saw through her so easily, and even more unhappy with my indifferent attitude. Her tone hardened again.  
"Can you let him go? Let yourself go? Stop draining each other and fueling resentment."  

**5**  
"What do you like about him?"  
Lin Wanwan blushed and lowered her head.  
She had met Zhuang Yang at a music festival. He was the first man she’d seen who looked so melancholy. Everyone else was reveling, but he was the only one standing on the sidelines smoking, full of deep thoughts, with eyes as profound as Tony Leung’s.  
Six guys asked for Lin Wanwan’s WeChat that day, but only Zhuang Yang told her to go back to school early, saying it was too dangerous for a girl to be out alone.  
Zhuang Yang offered to drive her back to school, opened the car door for her, buckled her seatbelt, and watched her walk into the dormitory building.  
That day, she fell for the considerate Zhuang Yang.  
And every time they went out together, Zhuang Yang would always shield her behind him.  
Listening to their sweet moments, I only felt irony.  
Lin Wanwan was laughable for believing the tender facade of a married man.  
But wasn’t I even more laughable?  
Thinking that this was love.  

**6**  
"Did you see the wedding ring on his finger?"  
I asked bluntly.  
But Lin Wanwan hesitated, her eyes unconsciously shifting away.  
"But he said your marriage was long dead, and he’d definitely divorce you!"  
Oh.  
So it wasn’t pity.  
It was stupidity.  
"Did he say when he’d divorce me?"  
"When your mother’s health improves, that’s when he’ll leave this family!"  
My mother’s illness?  
Seeing my confusion, Lin Wanwan continued.  
"Let Zhuang Yang go. I can give up everything, but I can’t lose this love."  
I looked at her tear-streaked face with a blank expression.  
"Agree to do three things for me. If after doing them, you still love him as much as you do now, I’ll walk away, on the condition that everything remains confidential."  
Lin Wanwan’s eyes lit up instantly, but she didn’t agree immediately.  
"It won’t involve breaking the law or morals. You can refuse anytime if you don’t want to do it."  
"Alright! You can’t go back on your word!"  
The agreement was made.  
Lin Wanwan left with her chest puffed out in pride.  

**7**  
Lin Wanwan also sent me a WeChat message that night.  
"We’ve set a time to meet tonight."  
The first task I had given her was to arrange a meeting with Zhuang Yang at a specific time.  
It had to be right after he received his health check report.  
At 11 PM, Zhuang Yang came home, looking slightly worn out compared to his usual energetic self.  
I pretended not to notice, playing the part of a daughter concerned for her mother’s health.  
"Let me see the report. There’s nothing wrong, right?"  
"It’s fine."  
Then, he took a crumpled document out of his bag.  
Just as I thought.  
I took the report to my study, turned on my computer, and looked up those medical terms I didn’t understand.  
I also sent Lin Wanwan a message.  
Even after seeing the results, Lin Wanwan still believed the scumbag’s words.  

**8**  
Lin Wanwan came to my office again.  
I took out a transparent folder containing altered lab results and a pregnancy test.  
When I placed it in front of her, she broke down without even looking closely.  
"Are you pregnant?"  
"It’s not me, it’s you."  
The second task was for Lin Wanwan to tell Zhuang Yang she was pregnant.  
Lin Wanwan hesitated after hearing this.  
Before the first task, the Lin Wanwan who had argued with me that "everyone has the right to pursue love" would have accepted it without hesitation, perhaps even imagining Zhuang Yang divorcing me and marrying her right away.  
But now, she didn’t have that confidence.  
Lin Wanwan still agreed.  
Two days later, Zhuang Yang worked late as planned.  
Lin Wanwan told Zhuang Yang about the pregnancy.  
"Brother, let’s get married."  
Zhuang Yang didn’t reply.  
Then, before Lin Wanwan could press further, he unilaterally ended the conversation.  
"Wait for my news."  
The next thing was the sound of a door closing, followed by Lin Wanwan’s sobs.  

**9**  
For three days, Lin Wanwan didn’t contact me, and Zhuang Yang didn’t go to her place.  
Zhuang Yang just smoked more, frowning, every night on the balcony, with his phone in hand.  
On the fourth day, Lin Wanwan stormed into my office, pushing past the receptionist.  
"Did you say something to Zhuang Yang?"  
I looked puzzled.  
"No, I didn’t."  
Lin Wanwan stared at me with wide eyes, tears streaming down her face.  
"He hasn’t replied to my WeChat all day. Last night, last night, he even said goodnight to me!"  
Lin Wanwan had been discarded.  
"Zhuang Yang won’t let you have a child, let alone marry you. He doesn’t even love you."  
I shattered the last hope in Lin Wanwan’s heart.  
"Just because you have more money than I do, because you can work in a nice office, because you’re better than me… better than me…"  
Lin Wanwan couldn’t finish her sentence. She felt inferior. I guessed this was something she couldn’t overcome.  
"Does Zhuang Yang love me just because of these external things?"  
I glanced at the family photo on my desk, with Zhuang Yang, my parents, and me.  
Maybe he loves my father, his status, and wealth. And, by extension, he loves me as the only daughter.  

**10**  
"Do you want to go through with the third task?"  
Lin Wanwan wavered, instinctively shaking her head.  
But I wanted to see it through.  
I stared into her eyes, asserting the authority of someone in a higher position, my tone leaving no room for refusal.  
"The third step will show you who Zhuang Yang truly loves."

**11**  
Lin Wanwan waited for Zhuang Yang in the company lobby for three hours.  
I waited for three hours too, hiding behind the plants in a coffee shop on the ground floor.  
"What do you want? Didn’t I say to wait for my news? Why are you here now?"  
Zhuang Yang’s voice was full of suppressed annoyance.  
He then approached Lin Wanwan, his tone growing colder.  
"Get rid of the baby. I’ll pay for it. Be good, understand?"  
Lin Wanwan was terrified, unsure of what to say.  
Even if it’s the person you love deeply, when a man is truly angry, a woman will instinctively fear that he might hit her or do something even worse.  
Zhuang Yang looked down at Lin Wanwan on the ground, his tone like someone shooing away a persistent beggar.  
"Don’t you understand human language?"

**12**  
The next day, I received a WeChat message from Lin Wanwan:  
"Help me."  
This time, we met at Lin Wanwan’s rented apartment.  
When I focused on her, I was shocked.  
Her arms were covered with visible bruises, and there was a bump on her smooth forehead.  
"He came over last night."  
"Did he hit you?"  
I looked at her exposed injuries and asked.  
Lin Wanwan looked depressed, shaking her head, then nodding, and finally lowering her head.  
The third task was for Lin Wanwan to ask Zhuang Yang to lend her money—not much, just 100,000 yuan.  
The reason was not just for the abortion but also because her parents had had an accident and needed some money for surgery.  
After hearing this, Zhuang Yang finally stopped cursing and quickly calmed down.  
"I’ll arrange it."  
Lin Wanwan believed him.  
But the next day, Zhuang Yang blocked her, and his phone was out of service.

**13**  
July was when Lin Wanwan was about to graduate.  
It was also the birthday of my Cancer father. Due to the pandemic and my deliberate arrangement, we were celebrating as a family.  
At 8 PM, Lin Wanwan pushed open the door to our private room right on time.  
Apart from me, the other three people in the room were stunned.  
Zhuang Yang turned pale when he saw Lin Wanwan.  
He quickly took the initiative, "Who are you? Did you walk into the wrong room? Don’t you see people are here?"  
He said this as he tried to push Lin Wanwan out.  
Lin Wanwan shook off his hand and fiercely told him,  
"My father had an accident and needs money for surgery, and I need money for the abortion, nutrition, and emotional damages. 100,000 yuan, and I’ll never bother you again!"  
Lin Wanwan looked at me and said, "Your husband cheated on you. This is the proof."  
Then she looked at Zhuang Yang as if she had nothing left to lose, "If you don’t pay up, I’ll give this report to her."  
My father stared at Zhuang Yang for a long time before asking,  
"Is this true?"  
Zhuang Yang panicked, his voice even cracking with a hint of sobbing.  
Then, he knelt.  
"Dad, I was wrong. I was momentarily confused. Honey, I promise I won’t do it again, really, I was a bastard, I deserve to die."  
My parents were also waiting for my response.  
"Let’s get divorced."  
Zhuang Yang crawled to my legs, still on his knees, "Honey, I love you. I don’t want a divorce. After you leave me, who will take care of you?"  
"I’m not asking for your opinion." With that, I stood up and walked out.  
With my father’s influence, Zhuang Yang voluntarily agreed to a divorce.  
Lin Wanwan also graduated.  
"Send me your bank account number."  
"For what?"  
"I’ll give you the 100,000 yuan."  
"I don’t want it. It’s not mine to take."  
"Okay."`;
