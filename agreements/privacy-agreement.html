</p>
<p>
    We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your Personal Data and your non-Personal Data for many of our Services.

</p>
<p>
    You also have the right to access Personal Data we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with.
</p>
<p>
    You also benefit from the rights to request the restriction of processing, and the portability of your Personal Data.

    12. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Platforms
</p>
<p>
    StoryNow allows other companies, called third party advertisers and advertising networks, to serve advertisements within our Services to deliver interest-based advertising to you about third party products and services.

    For changes to the Policy that we need to make to meet security, safety, legal or regulatory requirements, we may not be able to notify you in advance. Where we consider that any changes to the Policy are reasonably material, such as a change to the purposes of processing of personal data that is not consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected, we will (where reasonably practicable) notify you via inbox message or by posting the changes on our website. Any changes to this Policy will become effective immediately upon posting by us, unless we specify otherwise. We encourage you to periodically review the Policy to learn how StoryNow is protecting your information.
